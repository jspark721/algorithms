/*
Spiral Traversal of A Matrix

Given a two-dimentional matrix with m rows and n columns (m x n matrix), return its spiral ordering starting from the top left of the matrix (row 0, col 0)

Input:
[
 [ 1, 2, 3],
 [ 4, 5, 6],
 [ 7, 8, 9]
]
Output: [1,2,3,6,9,8,7,4,5]

Input:
[
  [1,2],
  [3,4],
  [5,6],
  [7,8]
]
Output: [1,2,4,6,8,7,5,3]
