/* write a function that, given:

1. an amount of money
2. an array of coin denominations

commutes the number of ways to make the amount of money with coins of the available denominations

example: for amount=4 (4 cents) and denominations=[1,2,3] (1c,2c, 3 cents), your program would output 4 -- the number of ways to make 4 cents with those denominations: 
1. 1c,1c,1c,1c
2. 1c,1c,2c
3. 1c,3c
4. 2c,2c
